  FYE Analysis              #
  RStudio                   #
#############################

This code was developed to evaluate the impact of First Year Experience course taken by FTIC students at EWU. Major findings inlcude slight but positive effects for individuals who take an FYE in fall-to-winter retention, however large and negative effects for those who fail the course.

 # GPA Deviation             #
 # RStudio                   #
#############################

This code was developed to evalaute the impact of GPA deviations from high school to college. In partnership with a naive bayes classification algorithm, 208 students from the Fall 2020 were identified as at risk of stopping out. The list of names and ID's were provided to EWU CAAR.

 # DFW Longitudinal Analysis #
 # RStudio                   #
#############################

This code was developed to evaluate the impact of DFW's recieved by students. This project will be improved upon by inlcuding Mark Wards program/course complexity data to
evaluate the effect of receiving a DFW in a course with high course importance. Degree Works will aid this research as well. This concept will also be incorporated into the 
Early Warning System project.

 # Graduated Grduating Datablock #
 # SQL Code for Argos            #
#################################

This is the code powering the graduated/applied to graduate datablock. This DataBlock was developed to be able to answer 80% of inquiries on students who have graduated or have
applied to graduate.

# JED Healthy Minds Survey #
############################

This code was devloped in consultation with the EWU JED team and the Healthy Minds Survey through University of Michigan. Nick Franco and the JED team tasked me with evaluating 
statistical differences between population groups.

This code gathers the data for the registration analysis detailed below.

#########################
# Registration Analysis #
# R Studio              #
#########################

This code was developed to examine students registration trends. The research question of interest was trying to identify a threshold after a students priority registration time
that rendered the student at risk of stoping out. This research will be used in the Early Warning System project being devloped now.
