 DFW Longitudinal Analysis #
 RStudio                   #
#############################

This code was developed to evaluate the impact of DFW's recieved by students. This project will be improved upon by inlcuding Mark Wards program/course complexity data to
evaluate the effect of receiving a DFW in a course with high course importance. Degree Works will aid this research as well. This concept will also be incorporated into the 
Early Warning System project.

This code was developed to examine students registration trends. The research question of interest was trying to identify a threshold after a students priority registration time
that rendered the student at risk of stoping out. This research will be used in the Early Warning System project being devloped now.
