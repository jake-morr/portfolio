0. Naive Bayes
RStudio

This code was used to run a predictive model on FTIC student retention. Overall model accuracy = 84%.

1. FYE Analysis
RStudio

This code was developed to evaluate the impact of First Year Experience course taken by FTIC students at EWU. Major findings inlcude slight but positive effects for individuals who take an FYE in fall-to-winter retention, however large and negative effects for those who fail the course.

This is the code used to gather the data for the FYE analysis described above.


2. GPA Deviation
RStudio

This code was developed to evalaute the impact of GPA deviations from high school to college. In partnership with a naive bayes classification algorithm, 208 students from the Fall 2020 were identified as at risk of stopping out. The list of names and ID's were provided to EWU CAAR.


3. DFW Longitudinal Analysis
RStudio

This code was developed to evaluate the impact of DFW's recieved by students. This project will be improved upon by inlcuding Mark Wards program/course complexity data to
evaluate the effect of receiving a DFW in a course with high course importance. Degree Works will aid this research as well. This concept will also be incorporated into the 
Early Warning System project.


4. HSI Forecast 
RStudio      

This code was developed to provide a forecast for the HSI committee and support EWU's initiative to become a Hispanic-Serving Institution.


5. Registration Analysis 
R Studio              

This code was developed to examine students registration trends. The research question of interest was trying to identify a threshold after a students priority registration time
that rendered the student at risk of stoping out. This research will be used in the Early Warning System project being devloped now.


6. JED Healthy Minds Survey

This code was devloped in consultation with the EWU JED team and the Healthy Minds Survey through University of Michigan. Nick Franco and the JED team tasked me with evaluating 
statistical differences between population groups.

7. Thesis Regression

This STATA code was developed to run clean the data and run the regressions for my Masters Thesis

8. Thesis Robustness Check

This STATA code was developed for the robustness checks portion of my Masters thesis

9. Retention Tracking

This code runs a retention tracking dashboard that allows users to evaluate retention year-over-year to the comparable date and time.
